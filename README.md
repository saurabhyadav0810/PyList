# PyList – A Python-like List Implementation in C++

This project implements a custom data structure **PyList**, inspired by Python's dynamic list, but written completely in **C++**.  
It supports multiple operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, resizing, and more, using a doubly linked list behind the scenes.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic list similar to Python lists  
- Insert elements at front, end, or at specific positions  
- Delete elements  
- Search for values  
- Display list contents  
- Internal implementation using Doubly Linked List  
- Simple, clean, and modular C++ code
